    "## Instructions\n",
    "1. The notebook is designed to run with Amazon SageMaker Studio. To use Studio, you will need to setup a SageMaker Domain. For instructions on how to onboard to a Sagemaker domain, refer to this [link](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/gs-studio-onboard.html).\n",

      "148, spk_0: um it can also be like a viral upper respiratory tract infection, but we will do some uh pulmonary function tests for you and see if uh the bronchodilator is just like you use the inhaler from your son if that helps um helps you with your symptoms and then we can go from there.\n",
